# Scratch-tennis-simulation
This is an primitive tennis game simulation by a starter in coding but a huge fan of tennis. The game is about the matching between J. Sinner and R. Nadal on clay court. This is designed for 2 players to play on one laptop.


Players will be manipulating the characters after the tennis ball in order to hit the ball back using (WASD/ ↑↓←→). Remember, there will be a short pause before the players hit the ball back, so please wait patiently.

Lastly, scores could be earned by letting the opponent opponent to touch the net or making the opponent fail to return the ball in time.

Note: the trajectory of the balls is completely random, so be prepared to run to every corner of the court.

Enjoy it!!!
